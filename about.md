### A little about me

I am currently studying a masters in data science at City, University of London.

From now until October 2018, I will be working on my final research project which is focussed on training reinforcement learning agent's in a multi-objective game scenario. 

The game I am using in my project is pinapple open faced chinese poker (POFC), more info on POFC [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-face_Chinese_poker).

### A little about City's Msc Data Science

To anyone interested in studying data science, I would definitely recommend City Uni. The course is broad so you get a good base of knowledge from all aspects of DS, whilst also being able to concentrate more on the things that interest you in term 2 electives. 

Modules I studied include **Visual Analytics**, **Big Data**, **Machine Learning**, **Neural Computing**, **Computer Vision** and **Software Agents** (Reinforcement Learning). [City DS website](https://www.city.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/data-science-msc).

### After the Course

Once I have completed my research project, I will be looking for employment in a DS role based in or near to London, UK. If you are recruiting and will have availablity from October 1st, please get in touch via ashmason1389@gmail.com, or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-mason-938104112/).
